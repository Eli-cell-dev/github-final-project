Question 3
https://github.com/Eli-cell-dev/github-final-project/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
The submitted URL correctly points to the repository named 'github-final-project' and redirects to the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file. However, the content of the file does not include all required sections: Our Pledge, Our Standards, Enforcement Responsibilities, Scope, Enforcement, Enforcement Guidelines, and Attribution. The provided content only mentions contributions and bug fixes, which does not meet the assignment's requirements. To improve your submission, please ensure that the CODE_OF_CONDUCT file includes all specified sections in detail.
Question 4
https://github.com/Eli-cell-dev/mcino-Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
The submitted URL does redirect to the CONTRIBUTING.md file; however, it does not contain the required repository name 'github-final-project'. The content of the file accurately includes the phrase: 'All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.' which meets part of the assignment's requirements. To improve your submission, ensure that the repository name in the URL matches the specified 'github-final-project'. This will help you meet the criteria fully and potentially earn the maximum points.
